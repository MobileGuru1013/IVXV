    # SSL Protocol Adjustments:
    # The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
    # approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
    # the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
    # approach you can use one of the following variables:
    # o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
    #    This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
    #    SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
    #    the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
    #    this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
    #    mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
    # o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
    #    This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
    #    SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
    #    alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
    #    practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
    #    this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
    #    works correctly.
    # Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
    # keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
    # keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
    # Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
    # their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
    # "force-response-1.0" for this.
